# About Agovia Edusphere Ventures

- Port clearance, mechanic support, and parts sourcing  
- Two-month average turnaround time  
- Direct delivery across Ghana from Accra or Kumasi

## ✈️ Student Travel & Study Abroad Services

We guide students from Ghana and other African countries through the complex journey of studying abroad:

## Why We Exist

Too often, students and car buyers face hidden costs, false promises, or lack of trustworthy guidance. **We built Agovia to be the opposite.** Honest. Professional. Clear.
